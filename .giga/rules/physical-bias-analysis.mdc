# physical-bias-analysis

Core Analysis Components:

1. Ball Weight Analysis System
- Statistical deviation tracking for individual ball weights
- Temporal stability analysis across draw sequences
- Confidence interval calculations for weight-based frequency variations
- Importance Score: 95/100

2. Equipment Monitoring Framework
- Machine-specific bias pattern detection
- Maintenance period correlation analysis
- Draw position frequency mapping
- Ball release mechanism variance tracking
- Importance Score: 90/100

3. Environmental Correlation Engine
- Temperature impact analysis on ball behavior
- Humidity effect correlation with draw patterns
- Atmospheric pressure relationship modeling
- Seasonal variation tracking
- Importance Score: 85/100

Key Business Rules:
- Minimum 50 consecutive draws required for valid bias detection
- Ball weight variations must exceed 0.01g threshold for consideration
- Environmental factors require 3-month correlation window
- Equipment change points must be validated across multiple metrics

Implementation Path: /physical_bias_detector.py
Core Functions:
