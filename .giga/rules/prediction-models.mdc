# prediction-models

The prediction system employs multiple specialized models working in concert:

## Core Prediction Components

### Quantum-Inspired Probability Model
Located in: advanced_ai_predictor.py
Importance Score: 85/100
- Implements quantum superposition concepts for number sampling
- Uses chaos theory (Lorenz attractor) for pattern detection
- Applies Fibonacci spiral analysis for sequence prediction

### Physical Bias Detection Model
Located in: physical_bias_detector.py
Importance Score: 90/100
- Analyzes mechanical lottery ball weight variations
- Detects equipment irregularities through statistical patterns
- Maps temporal patterns in machine performance
- Correlates environmental conditions with draw outcomes

### Unified Prediction Engine
Located in: unified_euromillions_predictor.py
Importance Score: 95/100
- Orchestrates multiple prediction strategies:
  - Physical bias detection results
  - Statistical frequency patterns
  - Gap analysis for overdue numbers
  - Quantum probability distributions
  - Chaos theory modeling
  - Fibonacci/Golden ratio correlations
- Implements weighted consensus algorithm
- Provides confidence scoring for predictions

## Model Integration Architecture

### Prediction Flow
1. Raw draw data ingestion
2. Physical bias analysis
3. Statistical pattern detection
4. Advanced probability modeling
