Primary Data Flow Pipeline:

1. Data Acquisition Layer
- euromillions_crawler.py ingests historical draw data
- Validates draw sequences and normalizes number ranges
- Feeds clean data to physical_bias_detector.py and analysis components
Importance Score: 75/100

2. Physical Analysis Pipeline
- physical_bias_detector.py processes raw draw sequences
- Detects mechanical biases and equipment irregularities
- Outputs bias confidence scores to prediction components
- Feeds temporal pattern data to unified predictor
Importance Score: 85/100

3. Prediction Generation Pipeline
- unified_euromillions_predictor.py coordinates multiple prediction streams:
  - Receives bias detection scores
  - Processes statistical frequency patterns
  - Integrates quantum-inspired sampling results
  - Applies chaos theory modeling
  - Generates consensus predictions through ensemble voting
Importance Score: 90/100

4. Confidence Enhancement Flow
- confidence_enhancer.py receives raw predictions
- Applies weighting based on historical accuracy
- Integrates physical bias scores
- Outputs final prediction confidence scores
Importance Score: 80/100

Key Data Flow Components:

1. Draw Sequence Analysis Pipeline
- Processes positional biases in draw order
- Feeds pattern recognition results to predictors
- Monitors equipment change indicators
Importance Score: 75/100

2. Prediction Consensus Flow
- Collects predictions from multiple sources
- Weights predictions based on confidence scores
- Generates unified prediction output
Importance Score: 85/100

Data Integration Points:
- Raw draw data → Physical bias detection
- Bias scores → Prediction generation
- Multiple predictions → Consensus algorithm
- Consensus predictions → Confidence enhancement
